            <p>Day 1 of our trip began with the excitement of exploring some of Karnatakaâ€™s hidden gems. Our first stop

            <p>We set out early in the morning to catch the beauty of Vibuthi Falls at its finest. Located amidst lush
                greenery, Vibuthi Falls is a pristine waterfall that cascades down in multiple tiers, creating a
                mesmerizing sight. The trek to the falls was an adventure in itself, as we navigated through dense

                As we approached the falls, the sound of cascading water grew louder, heightening our anticipation. The

            <p>After two days of exploring the serene beaches of Gokarna and soaking in the spiritual ambiance of

            <p>As the day wound down, we opted for a tranquil <strong>coracle ride</strong> on the river. Coracles are
                traditional round boats made of bamboo and are unique to the region. The slow drift along the river was
                a stark contrast to the day's earlier activities, allowing us to relax and soak in the beauty of the
                surroundings. During the ride, we spotted various birds and even caught a glimpse of some wildlife along
